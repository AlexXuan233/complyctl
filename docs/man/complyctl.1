.SH NAME
complyctl \- Complyctl CLI perform compliance assessment activities
using plugins for different underlying technologies.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]complyctl\f[R] [command] [flags]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Complyctl CLI leverages OSCAL to perform compliance assessment
activities, using plugins for each stage of the lifecycle.
.PP
Complyctl can be extended to support desired policy engines (PVPs) by
the use of plugins.
The plugin acts as the integration between complyctl and the PVPs native
interface.
Each plugin is responsible for converting the policy content described
in OSCAL into the input format expected by the PVP.
In addition, the plugin converts the raw results provided by the PVP
into the schema used by complyctl to generate OSCAL output.
.PP
Plugins communicate with complyctl via gRPC and can be authored using
any preferred language.
The plugin acts as the gRPC server while the complyctl CLI acts as the
client.
When a complyctl command is run, it invokes the appropriate method
served by the plugin.
.PP
Complyctl is built on
https://github.com/oscal\-compass/compliance\-to\-policy\-go which
provides a flexible plugin framework for leveraging OSCAL with various
PVPs.
