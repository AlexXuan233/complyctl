# NAME

openscap-plugin - a plugin which extends the complyctl capabilities to use OpenSCAP.

# DESCRIPTION

The plugin is not meant to be executed directly, it communicates with complyctl via gRPC. It has configurable options that can be configured via a manifest file, Complyctl processes the manifest file and sends the configuration values to the plugin.

When the plugin receives the **generate** command from complyctl, it will generate a tailing policy file and remediation files for bash, ansible, and imagebuilder. The generated files are placed in the **openscap** directory under workspace.

When the plugin receives the **scan** command from complyctl, it will scan the system with **oscap** and return the observations to complyctl.

The generated remediation files from complyctl are based on the whole policy, it's not targeted to remediate specific findings. **oscap** could be used to manually generate remediation scripts containing only remediation for failed rules based on complyctl scan result.

# FILES

# EXAMPLES
