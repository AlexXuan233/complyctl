.SH NAME
openscap\-plugin \- a plugin which extends the complyctl capabilities to
use OpenSCAP.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The plugin is not meant to be executed directly, it communicates with
complyctl via gRPC.
It has configurable options that can be configured via a manifest file,
Complyctl processes the manifest file and sends the configuration values
to the plugin.
.PP
When the plugin receives the \f[B]generate\f[R] command from complyctl,
it will generate a tailing policy file and remediation files for bash,
ansible, and imagebuilder.
The generated files are placed in the \f[B]openscap\f[R] directory under
workspace.
.PP
When the plugin receives the \f[B]scan\f[R] command from complyctl, it
will scan the system with \f[B]oscap\f[R] and return the observations to
complyctl.
.PP
The generated remediation files from complyctl are based on the whole
policy, it\[cq]s not targeted to remediate specific findings.
\f[B]oscap\f[R] could be used to manually generate remediation scripts
containing only remediation for failed rules based on complyctl scan
result.

.PP
Find value of the result ID in scan result file:
.PP
$ oscap info <scan_result.xml>
.PP
Generate a remediation Ansible Playbook based on the scan result:
.PP
$ oscap xccdf generate fix \[en]fix\-type ansible \[en]result\-id 
\[en]tailoring\-file <tailoring_policy.xml> \[en]output
<profile_remediations.yml> <scan_result.xml>
