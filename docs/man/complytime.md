# NAME

complyctl - ComplyTime CLI perform compliance assessment activities using plugins for different underlying technologies.

# SYNOPSIS

**complyctl** [command] [flags]

# DESCRIPTION

complyctl leverages OSCAL to perform compliance assessment activities, using plugins for each stage of the lifecycle.

complyctl can be extended to support desired policy engines (PVPs) by the use of plugins.
The plugin acts as the integration between complyctl and the PVPs native interface.
Each plugin is responsible for converting the policy content described in OSCAL into the input format expected by the PVP.
In addition, the plugin converts the raw results provided by the PVP into the schema used by ComplyTime to generate OSCAL output.

Plugins communicate with complyctl via gRPC and can be authored using any preferred language. The plugin acts as the gRPC server while the complyctl acts as the client. When a complyctl command is run, it invokes the appropriate method served by the plugin.

complyctl is built on https://github.com/oscal-compass/compliance-to-policy-go which provides a flexible plugin framework for leveraging OSCAL with various PVPs.
