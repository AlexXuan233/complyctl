This quick start guide aims to set up the minimum environment to explore the ComplyTime CLI.
If you intend to run the ComplyTime CLI on a real target system, the content will need to be updated.

cd complytime/docs/scripts/
```
2. Set the APPS_REPO variable to the app Yum repository URL:

export APPS_REPO=${APPS_REPO} # Change the ${APPS_REPO} to the app yum repo
```
3. Build the container image:
```bash
podman build --build-arg APPS_REPO=${APPS_REPO} . -t quick-start:latest
podman run -it quick-start:latest /bin/bash
